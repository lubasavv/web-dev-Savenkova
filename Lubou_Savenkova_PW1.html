    <dt id="question a">Question a: When HTML5 has become a standard? What were the main reasons for developing new standard?</dt>
   <p> <dd>HTML5 became a standard on October 28, 2014. 
    The main reasons for developing the new standard were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. It also aimed to reduce the need for external plugins (such as Flash) and provide better error handling. Additionally, HTML5 was developed to address the shortcomings of previous versions of HTML and to adapt to the changing needs of web development.</dd></p>
    <dt id="question b">Question b: What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
    <p><dd>The main difference between the W3C HTML5 specification and the WHATWG HTML Living Standard lies in their development processes and update cycles. The W3C HTML5 specification is a snapshot that was published in 2014, while the WHATWG HTML Living Standard is continuously updated as new features are developed and implemented.</dd></p>
    <dt id="question c">Question c: What is the minimal HTML page code?</dt>
    <p> <dd>Code includes the essential components of an HTML page, such as the doctype declaration , the opening and closing tags, the head section with the title of the document, and the body section containing the content of the page.</dd></p>
    <dt id="question d">Question d: Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</dt>
    <p> <dd>Semantic markup uses HTML elements to convey content meaning for better understanding by search engines and assistive technologies. It focuses on content structure over appearance. In contrast, presentational markup defines visual presentation using HTML elements like font or b, which is now deprecated due to mixing content with presentation. Semantic markup leads to cleaner, more accessible, and maintainable code, enhancing website accessibility and search engine optimization.</dd></p>
    <dt id="question e">Question e: How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</dt>
    <p> <dd>To find out if a particular HTML tag or attribute is supported by browsers, you can refer to the W3Schools HTML Reference. This resource offers a detailed list of HTML elements and their attributes, including information on browser compatibility. It provides insights into which browsers support each tag and attribute for your reference.</dd></p>
    <dt id="question f">Question f: What are the audio and video formats, officially supported by HTML standard? What happens if you use other format?</dt>
    <p> <dd>HTML5 supports AAC, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis for audio and Ogg Theora, WebM and MPEG-4 for video.If you use a video or audio format other than these , it may not be universally playable across all browsers. Some users might experience issues with playback or compatibility.</dd></p>
